👋 Hi, I’m Michael

🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate computer engineering graduate with a strong interest in robotics, data science, and backend development. My journey into tech started with front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has expanded into Python, with ongoing learning in C++ and C.

Currently, I’m working on developing a drone project, aiming to build a functional prototype that combines software engineering and hardware design—blending my love for robotics and engineering.

My hands-on experience also includes working as an Audio Visual Technician for a production company, where I developed technical problem-solving skills and gained exposure to complex systems. Beyond that, I continuously expand my skill set through personal projects and self-guided learning.

🌱 Outside of Tech

When I’m not coding, you can find me reading, exploring the outdoors, or hitting the gym. I believe balance fuels creativity and innovation!
